Hi there! I am Daksh Shah, a third year Computer Science/Math major at UC Santa Cruz.
I'm interested in Computer Vision and Graphics with applications to medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and accessibility. I also enjoy systems programming and computer architecture.

## Research
My current research is in:
- MRI Differentiable Simulators and Medical Imaging
- Robotics with Autonomous Vehicle Scene Analysis and Decision-making
- ASL Gesture Recognition
